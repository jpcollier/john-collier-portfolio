# John Collier

**Hey, my name is John Collier.** 

I'm a data analyst at Community Solutions, working to bring an end to homelessness.

I have over seven years of experience in data analysis, data visualization, policy research, and web development. 

My objective is to leverage my expertise to help foster productive and equitable communities where all can thrive. Through compelling visualizations, in-depth analysis, and impactful policy research, I aim to engage and educate individuals, enabling them to make informed decisions and contribute to the development of sustainable and inclusive cities.

That's me. The rest of this website serves to show you a collection of some of my work.
