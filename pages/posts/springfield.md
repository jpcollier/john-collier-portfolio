This report presents an in-depth analysis of the market-rate and affordable housing markets in Springfield, and recommends policies and strategies that can strengthen the Cityâ€™s housing market. As a co-author of the report, I worked closely with city officials to set research goals and to collect administrative data. My final analysis included a data visualization which categorized the different housing markets in Springfield based on a k-mean cluster analysis using a variety of indicators including vacancy, foreclosures, sale prices, and employment.
