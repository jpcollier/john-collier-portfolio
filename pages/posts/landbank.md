This report sought to quantify the economic impact of land banking activity in Central Ohio from 2012-2018. The analysis required the cleaning and aggregation of land bank data as well as an extensive literature review on research regarding the economic effect of vacant housing on surrounding land value. Additionally, to complement the quantitative analysis, I conducted numerous interviews with land bank partners.
