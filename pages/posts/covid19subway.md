Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence"

New York City’s subway system has been pretty quiet lately. If you can forgive the cheesy Simon and Garfunkel lyrics - let’s take a look at data from the MTA amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Even during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, NYC never shut down its subway system completely. The MTA is the lifeblood of the city and continued to serve as means for transportation for thousands of essential workers. But with the shutdown that began in early March, ridership plummeted. Compared to last year’s ridership numbers, total ridership on buses and subways alike fell 80-90%. 

As of Monday (6/22) New York City has officially entered Phase 2 of reopening. Ridership is still no where near pre-COVID levels. Interestingly, bus ridership is now nearly the same as subway ridership (during normal times, subway ridership is several magnitudes greater).
