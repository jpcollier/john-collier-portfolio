The Smaller Legacy City Toolkit is an online resource for practitioners in small legacy cities around the country. The toolkit is organized around the eight strategies for small legacy city revitalization identified in the report Revitalizing Americaâ€™s Smaller Legacy Cities.

I co-authored this toolkit by performing extensive online research of existing resources for city practitioners on issues such as capacity building, placemkaing, and planning. I also conducted an in-depth case study on the application of these strategies in the city of South Bend, IN. The website was developed and designed by me using the Wordpress platform.
